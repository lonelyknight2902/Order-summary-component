Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('üéâ')
}
```

### Continued development

In the future, I want to continue to perfect my CSS skills and move on to React as well as exploring to the backend and other technologies. My top priority would be creating my personal website and a website for touring my former high school (due to the COVID-19 pandemic, new students still haven't gotten the chance to tour our beloved school).
